[Since we're doing confessions](https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemship/open-letter-to-ned-and-dan-you-badly-need-a-communications-community-content-expert-and-i-hereby-nominate-stellabelle-or), I want to be a Steemit whale. I'm pretty sure everyone who isn't a whale on Steemit wants to be a whale at this point. 

But this pond simply isn't big enough yet.

After watching this space grow and develop, and putting a great deal of 'brain processing time' towards thinking of solutions or being 'first' with a novel idea or concept, I've been able to identify leadership traits in a number of Steemians. Reading through the comment thread of @steemship's post above should make it rather apparent which 'leaders' I'm talking about.

These people may not know they are leaders, but they are. They're speaking out and moving out in the absence of a 'centralized structure of authority'. 

I'm not advocating for anything of the sort, however a centralized authority structure does exist and their names are @dantheman and @ned. 

They are the __de facto authoritative leaders__ in this, primarily because they hold the commit keys to the code, but also because __this is their baby__.

Contrary to the opinions of a number of well-rewarded authors on this amazing platform, __authority is a natural derivative of leadership traits__. Certain people are born with these leadership traits while others develop them through hard experience. Sometimes both.

Often, this authority becomes overblown and oppressive, but that discussion is not the purpose of this post. There is __no shortage__ of posts about that topic on Steemit.

The point is, leaders develop into authoritative figures. A better way of putting it, they develop into "respected figures" of a community. These figures develop a core of supporters who in turn share a degree of this burden/blessing. 

For instance, Jeff Berwick (@dollarvigilante) is an easy example of an __authoritative figure__ from the voluntaryist/anarchist demographic.

Charlie Shrem (@charlieshrem) is another authoritative figure in the bitcoin/cryptocurrency space due to his early adoption and entrepreneurship in the space.

This is a _natural_ process of any ecosystem. 

They both, among the other numerous leaders within Steemit deserve our praise (and our upvotes). 

But there is a burden of authority, and for anyone who has never shouldered that burden, it can apparently be shockingly easy to throw jabs when its not _you_ in the spotlight.

So here we all find ourselves, on the 15th anniversary of 9/11, reading the words from a stranger over ultra-high speed, lossless internet connections. Interestingly, we're arguing over who should awarded more of a valuable digital asset in exchange for uploading collections of writings, images, and videos into a globally shared database. 

More interesting still, this 'globally shared database' acts as both online security service and a frictionless, asset transfer protocol, controlled by noone and everyone simultaneously.

Icing on the cake: no one even knows who invented this, so no one entity is theoretically able to capitalize on the infrastructure more than the other. 

Yet, predictably, we are arguing. That's what humans do when incentives aren't aligned... or at least perceptions of incentives aren't aligned. Or maybe perceptions of others incentives don't align with what you perceive to be your incentives? 

You should begin to see the loop developing here. 

So what does all of this mean? How can incentives ever be aligned if we all have different motivations and perspectives? The same way it's always happened.

Leaders must appear. _Leadership_ must stand up. Leaders make devise plans to accomplish tasks, and seek out ways to execute those tasks. 

Some build tools and help with the development angle. Others help strengthen the community with different experiments and rallying cries.

This is how its supposed to work. 

The end goal of anyone that I count as a 'member' of this platform should be __grow the ecosystem so I can prosper alongside other 'growers'__. 

What can be done to add value and expand into new markets and mind-shares?
