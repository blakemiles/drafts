With the transparency of the Steem blockchain, there are a few advantages in terms of analyzing. There's a degree of near-perfect market information, which makes deciding how news and events will affect the market price of a Steem token. Here are just a few examples:
## Critical Importance:
* exactly when 'whales' send their tokens to exchanges
* exactly how much the 'whales' send to the exchanges
* the amount of buy support in each individual exchange as well as existing asks (sellers with orders already on the books)

## Serious Importance:
* the number of newly powered down tokens that will be made available in the immediate future
* ability for anyone with the drive or knowledge to account for every single token in the system
* ability to know at any moment in time the exact percentage of tokens that have been powered up
* the percentage of users that are powering down
* the percentage of total Steem Power that is being powered down

## Moderate Imporatnce
* _what_ is powering down
* precisely when the power downs will occur
* what specific users generally do with their tokens after a power down
* roughly how many SBD tokens will be rewarded and potentially entering into the market in the immediate future

With each of these points, _every single situation_ provides additional context to the evolving situation. This provides further indicators of various importance in which traders can make decisions based on how they weight these 'indicators'.
